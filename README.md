# The-Avro-Project
A game based on a game I had previously created in Turing, but remastered with c++ and now in #d, along side its own engine, rendering engine, and Utility set

This project is inteded to be cross platform, but as I have no knowledge of programming in linux or unix, I have no idea how to do exactly that, so if you feel that 
you want to contribute and create these platform layers yourself, go ahead

To build (at least on windows) you must:
* Download and Install CMake
* Obtain a copy of Visual Studio 2013 (no other IDE's were tested)
* Run the corresponding GenVSsolutionx??.bat where ?? is your cpu architecture (either 32 or 64)
* Enter the folder created by the .bat file and run the sln file
* Set AvroArrow as startup project (Important, or else wont run)
* Press F7 to compile code, and run it in debug mode by pressing F5
* report bugs and ideas to me at zaeemkmohamed@gmail.com
